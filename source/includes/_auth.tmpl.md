# Authentication

All requests must use standard [HTTP Basic Auth][basicAuth] headers with the [HTTPS][https] protocol.

You don't need to provide a password for Basic Auth; simply use your secret API key as the Basic Auth user.

Remember, your secret API key is _secret_, so do not share it with anyone.
